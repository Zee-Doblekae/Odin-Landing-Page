            <p>I had been climbing the corporate latter for over three decades before BB Robotics came out with this technology. I originally got the upgrade to be a better asset to my compony. However, after getting the upgrade I realized I had been worth more than my superiors realized all along! I made the best decision of my life and quit on the spot. 6 Months later im running my own startup!</p>
